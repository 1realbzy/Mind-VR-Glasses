## Mind VR Glasses Vision
Imagine a world where your thoughts become 3D realities. *Mind VR Glasses* uses EEG to capture mental imagery, a top LLM to decode it, and VR to display interactive visuals. Target: African education (e.g., teachers seeing student concepts), architecture (e.g., affordable home designs), and health (e.g., mental diagnostics). Inspired by Tony Starkâ€™s JARVIS, this is about empowering minds globally.
