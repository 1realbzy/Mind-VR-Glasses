Mind VR Glasses: Unleash Your Mind’s Potential
Welcome to Mind VR Glasses, a groundbreaking vision to revolutionize how we interact with our thoughts. Imagine crafting 3D designs, teaching concepts, or diagnosing health issues—all by harnessing your mental imagery with cutting-edge tech. This is where imagination meets reality, Tony Stark-style!
Vision

What It Is: A non-invasive wearable using EEG to capture brain signals, processed by AI (e.g., Uhuru/Alke LLM), and rendered as interactive 3D visuals in VR glasses.
Why It Matters: Empowers African communities with tools for education (visualizing student ideas), architecture (affordable housing designs), and health (mental diagnostics).
The Dream: Turn mental blueprints into tangible innovations, accessible to all.

Tech Stack (Planned)

EEG Hardware: Scalp sensors (e.g., OpenBCI) to detect brain activity.
AI/ML: Integration with Uhuru/Alke LLM for decoding mental imagery.
VR Display: Lightweight glasses for 3D visualization.
Languages/Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Unity (TBD).

Getting Started
This repo is the launchpad. Check out the vision board to see the big picture. Contributions welcome—fork, star, and let’s build together!
Roadmap

Phase 1: Define architecture and simulate EEG data (in progress).
Phase 2: Prototype EEG-AI integration with Uhuru/Alke.
Phase 3: Develop VR interface and test real-world use cases.
